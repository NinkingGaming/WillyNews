This morning a very surprising discovery was made. A paper towel was found in New Jersey that said "I'm Gay - George Washington." <img style="padding: 5px; float: left;" height="256px" src="https://willynews.com/images/1.2.png"> <br><br>This has led the LGBTQ movement to make efforts of appealing to the older generation. A chain reaction has sprung up and many eldery people are coming out as gay. Many members of the LGBTQ movement have stated they knew he was gay all along. We asked one and heres what they had to say: "I just knew he was gay. He just gave off those vibes." <br><br>Many have claimed there are other paper towels proving other famous people were gay all along. May the search continue.
